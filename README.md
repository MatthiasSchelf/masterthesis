This code was used in the analysis of the Masterthesis titled "Evaluating different measures of working memory (overload) on the basis of Mutual Information (MI)".

This code consists of the preprocessing code and the analysis itself. 

The code for the anlysis is based on the code of Ince (https://github.com/robince/gcmi), in which the Information Theoretic Framework and its functionalities are put into easy to use code.
